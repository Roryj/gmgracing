    <p style="margin-left: 15px ; margin-right: 15px ;">Rosamond, CA - In only its second weekend racing Pirelli P Zero Racing Slicks, GMG Racing posted another big win - this time capturing qualifying by nearly three seconds over the next-fastest car, and then going on to obliterate the competition - winning the Porsche Owner's Club Racing Weekend race at Willow Springs Raceway with a ten-second margin.   GMG's Porsche 997 WC Cup car set the fastest time ever in a Cup car (non-RS or RSR) with a time of 1:19.6.  Driver and GMG co-owner James Sofronas is new to the Pirelli Motorsport family, but after sweeping the BMW CCA (Car Club of America) Club Race CM Class during last week's BMWCCA West Coast season finale club race, and following that up with a huge weekend at Willow Springs in his Porsche - he is a believer.  
 
<p style="margin-left: 15px ; margin-right: 15px ;">&quot;This was the first time we ran the Pirelli slicks on our WC car,&quot; explained Sofronas.  &quot;Once again we were the fastest car leading practice in the morning, and when qualifying came around, we set the pace with a 1:19.7 and won the overall pole by over 3 seconds!&quot;</p>
 
<p style="margin-left: 15px ; margin-right: 15px ;">Once the green flag dropped, Sofronas took a commanding lead on the first lap and lead the entire sprint race winning by over 7 seconds. During the race, James equaled his qualifying time with a fastest race lap of 1:19.7 and then cruised to victory.</p>
 
<p style="margin-left: 15px ; margin-right: 15px ;">&quot;Pirelli once again showed it makes the best tires in the world!&quot; Sofronas added.</p>
