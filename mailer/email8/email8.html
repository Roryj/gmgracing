Running three cars is a big task for the GMG Racing team, but the team will bring two more to the party at this weekend's Toyo Tires World Challenge at Long Beach presented by Bondurant. GMG Racing will field five cars that will compete on the streets of Long Beach, the third round of the 2010 World Challenge season.</font></p>

<p style="width:605px;text-align:left;margin-bottom:4px; margin-left:5px; margin-right:5px;" ><font size="1.5" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Defending race winner James Sofronas enters the race as the point's leader in the #14 GMG Porsche WC-GT3 Cup. Joing him will be teammate Dino Crescentini, winner of the last round at St. Petersburg in the #4 GMG / Stoptech Porsche WC-GT3 Cup, and William Ziegler, the 2009 World Challenge Rookie of the Year, in the #05 GMG / Swisher Porsche WC-GT3 Cup.</font></p>

<p style="width:605px;text-align:left;margin-bottom:4px; margin-left:5px; margin-right:5px;" ><font size="1.5" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I am really excited to not only enter the Long Beach Grand Prix as the World Challenge points leader, but to race with such a strong team in our home race," said Sofronas. "This is the largest team that we have ever brought to a World Challenge event, and we have a great chance to have another GMG Racing Porsche in the winners circle on Sunday afternoon."</font></p>

<p style="width:605px;text-align:left;margin-bottom:4px; margin-left:5px; margin-right:5px;" ><font size="1.5" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Competing in their first World Challenge race will be Brent Holden and Gary Tolar. Holden, a veteran of IMSA's Patron GT3 Challenge, will be piloting the #24 GMG Porsche WC-GT3 in the GT class, while Gary Tolar will round out the five car team when he competes in the GTS class in the #86 GMG / Tolar Manufacturing Porsche 996 GS.</font></p>

<p style="width:605px;text-align:left;margin-bottom:4px; margin-left:5px; margin-right:5px;" ><font size="1.5" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"We certainly have our work cut out for us at this year's LBGP as the competition is going to be fierce," said Fabryce Kutyba, vice president of Global Motorsports Group. "Everyone has stepped up their game in 2010. A full field with three classes of cars all racing together will require speed and consistency to finish at the top. The guys on the team have been working extremely hard between St. Petersburg and Long Beach to make the cars perfect. I am hopeful that our combination of GMG World Challenge suspension components, Stoptech Brakes and the reliability of the WC-GT3 Cup cars will once again be the package to beat."</font></p>

<p style="width:605px;text-align:left;margin-bottom:4px; margin-left:5px; margin-right:5px;" ><font size="1.5" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">GMG Racing will also field a car in Saturday's American Le Mans Series race, the #32 GMG / Spectra Resources Porsche 911 GT3 Cup, for Sofronas and teammate Bret Curtis.</font></p>

        <p style="width:605px;text-align:left;margin-bottom:4px; margin-left:5px; margin-right:5px;" ><font size="1.5" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Competing in the world-famous Grand Prix of Long Beach is a highlight of the season for GMG Racing, based in nearby Orange County. With the team based so close to the Grand Prix, a large number of customers, friends, family, and team supporters make their way to the race to visit the team throughout the weekend, and cheer for the team in the weekend-ending World Challenge race.</font></p>

<p style="width:605px;text-align:left;margin-bottom:4px; margin-left:5px; margin-right:5px;" ><font size="1.5" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">No doubt the highlight of GMG Racing's appearances on the streets of Long Beach was James Sofronas' victory in the World Challenge race in 2009. This year, GMG Racing's fans will also get to cheer their team on in the American Le Mans Series' Tequila Patron Grand Prix on April 17, as Sofronas will join Bret Curtis in the No.32 GMG / Spectra Resources Porsche 911 GT3 Cup.</font></p>

<p style="width:605px;text-align:left;margin-bottom:4px; margin-left:5px; margin-right:5px;" ><font size="1.5" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The two drivers partnered in the season-opening 12 Hours of Sebring, where they enjoyed a strong run in their GMG-prepared Porsche and were battling for a podium position until they were hit by a prototype in the late stages of the race. The contact forced the car behind the wall to repair a broken radiator and effectively took them out of contention, but the team made it to the checkered flag. Their strong form and ultimate bad luck have left team owner Sofronas ready to put on a strong show in front of the team’s home crowd.</font></p>

<p style="width:605px;text-align:left;margin-bottom:4px; margin-left:5px; margin-right:5px;" ><font size="1.5" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Long Beach is a really great event, and one that has historically been very good for GMG Racing," said Sofronas. "We are really looking forward to getting a result that the team deserves in the ALMS race.  The crew worked so hard and so well in Sebring, and to get taken out of it was hard to take. Bret is ready, and I know I am also ready, to get the GMG / Spectra Resources Porsche on the podium."</font></p>

<p style="width:605px;text-align:left;margin-bottom:4px; margin-left:5px; margin-right:5px;" ><font size="1.5" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In contrast to the 12 Hours of Sebring, where the emphasis for the drivers was on making sure the car survived to the end, Long Beach will be a 100 minute sprint race – not unlike the World Challenge race that Sofronas won in 2009.</font></p>

<p style="width:605px;text-align:left;margin-bottom:4px; margin-left:5px; margin-right:5px;" ><font size="1.5" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"The approach for Long Beach is completely different than Sebring," said Sofronas. "Our Porsche, with its Global Motorsports Group parts, will run strong and fast throughout the race so every lap is about getting the most out of the package. In a way, it is more fun because we are driving at ten-tenths every lap. It is also a great race for the fans, with battles all over the track between the GT and Prototype cars."</font></p>

<p style="width:605px;text-align:left;margin-bottom:4px; margin-left:5px; margin-right:5px;" ><font size="1.5" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">GMG Racing will also take part in Sunday's World Challenge race, with Porsche 911 GT3's entered for regular drivers Sofronas, Dino Crescentini, and William Ziegler, as well as first-time Long Beach competitors Brent Holden and Gary Tolar. Sofronas enters the weekend as the series point’s leader, while Crescentini won the series’ previous race in St. Petersburg.</font></p>
